We are excited to welcome visitors from around the globe to PyCon Zimbabwe. This international gathering presents the possibility of encountering individuals who may have COVID-19 or its variants. To ensure the safety of all attendees, we are implementing the following health precautions for those who may be at risk or who have not yet been vaccinated.

---------------------------------
Masks Available but Not Mandatory
---------------------------------


While wearing masks will not be a requirement, we will provide them at all conference venues. We strongly encourage anyone who feels at risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19 to wear a mask during the conference and in its surroundings. Your participation in safeguarding our community is greatly appreciated.

---------------------------
Vaccination Recommendations
---------------------------

We highly recommend that all attendees get vaccinated against COVID-19 with vaccines that are accessible in their local areas. Vaccination not only protects you but also contributes to the safety and well-being of our entire community.

------------------
COVID-19 Testing
------------------

To further ensure a safe environment, we ask that delegates utilize rapid or antigen test kits to assess their COVID-19 status both prior to and during the conference. This simple step can help us maintain a healthy and enjoyable event for everyone.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to the health and safety of all attendees at PyCon Zimbabwe. We look forward to an inspiring and enriching experience together!
